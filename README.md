Drop-down Menus

You know what we’re talking about here. Picture a nav-bar or a button and when you click it the menu slides down nicely. As mentioned previously, you already know everything you need to create this element. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Mobile menus

Mobile versions of your sites are almost definitely going to need their own menu implementation. Depending on how you decided to implement your drop-down, you could reuse it here, but there are tons of more inventive options out there.

Browse the web for some inspiration, pick something and try to implement it!
Image slider

Again, there’s not much instruction needed here - just practice.

Create a simple image carousel. It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backward. It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds. It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be click-able to advance to that particular slide).
